    <span> Assurance</span><br>
    Quality Assurance, or QA for short, is the systematic monitoring and evaluation of the various aspects of an educational institution<br> to maximize the probability that minimum standards of quality are being attained by the production process. It is the way that guarantees<br> that the institution has achieved its educational efficacy and adopted academic standards derived from the institutionâ€™s mission<br> which is defined and attained in a way commensurate with the national or international standards.<br>
    <br>
    <span>Accreditation</span> <br>
    Accreditation is a type of quality assurance process under which services and operations of educational institutions or <br>programs are evaluated by an external body to determine if applicable standards are met.
    <br>What will happen if accreditation is not granted?
    If accreditation is not granted, graduates will face the following problems:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>-Fewer job opportunities.</li>
        <li>-Inability to gain accreditation of their degrees if they wish to accredit their degree<br> in a peer accredited institution.</li>
        <li>-The faculty will lose its independent structure and hence it will join another accredited entity.</li>
    </ul>
